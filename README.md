# explorejson
A proof-of-concept web-based Explorer for JSON data.

This concept uses a built-in json data file with one main array. The objects in that array are clickable in the left panel to show the details on the right. basic CRUD functionality is working to create new objects, read and update objects, and delete objects.

Would like to eventually generalize this so that it can provide a tree structure to any json data pointed at it with multiple arrays and treat it much like a file explorer. Currently uses basic CSS styling.

Supported on node.js - clone the project and run "npm install" in the project folder.

Start the server with "node app" to run on localhost:3000
